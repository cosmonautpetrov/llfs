llfs, or linked list file system:

A small hobbyist file system written for 1.44 floppies.

Not of any real particular use, just a fun project I thought I'd write as part of the osdev community.

llfs works through linked lists of directory and file blocks which can be easily and quickly parsed
by low-level code.
